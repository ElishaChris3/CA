Carbon Aegis Overview
Carbon Aegis is a comprehensive Sustainability Reporting SaaS platform designed to help organizations comply with the growing regulatory demands for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures. The platform is specifically tailored for companies in need of CSRD/ESRS compliance but is flexible enough to serve businesses across industries, providing a scalable solution for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions accounting, double materiality assessments, and report generation aligned with the European Union's ESRS framework.

Carbon Aegis aims to simplify the complex world of sustainability reporting through automation, centralized data management, and user-friendly interfaces, enabling companies to reduce manual effort, ensure compliance, and present data in the required formats.

Key Features of Carbon Aegis
ESRS and CSRD Compliance:

Enables organizations to meet the ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) and CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) by providing structured templates, automated reporting, and regulatory guidance.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting:

Users can input data for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions with integrated emission factors for automatic calculation, tracking, and reporting.

Double Materiality Assessment (DMA):

Users can assess both the financial materiality and impact materiality of various ESG topics, helping them identify what disclosures to report based on their business' sustainability risks.

Modular Design:

The platform is built with a modular design that allows users to choose the relevant modules for their needs, such as GHG Accounting, ESRS Reporting, VSME (for small- and medium-sized enterprises), and Stakeholder Engagement.

Real-Time Collaboration:

Carbon Aegis integrates with Notion to allow for real-time collaboration across teams, keeping all relevant stakeholders on the same page and managing their tasks and deliverables efficiently.

Data Ingestion:

Flexible data ingestion options support manual entry, bulk Excel imports, and API integrations with other enterprise systems, ensuring that data can be easily collected, validated, and standardized for reporting.

Reporting and Document Generation:

Carbon Aegis can automatically generate ESRS-compliant reports in Word, PDF, and Excel formats, allowing users to easily export and integrate their reports into their annual reports or investor disclosures.

VSME (Very Small and Medium Enterprises) Module:

Specialized support for SMEs to ensure they can meet regulatory demands without complexity, offering easy-to-use templates and checklists aligned with EFRAGâ€™s (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) VSME standards.

The platform supports role-based access control, where consultants can manage multiple clients, and clients can have access to their own subsidiaries, departments, or stakeholders while ensuring data segregation and security.

Audit Trail and Versioning:

Tracks every change made to the data and the reports, ensuring full auditability of ESG reports, which can be easily reviewed by stakeholders or auditors.
