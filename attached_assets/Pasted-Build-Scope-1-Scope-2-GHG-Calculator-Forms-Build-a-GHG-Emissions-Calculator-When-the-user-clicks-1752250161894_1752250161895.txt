Build Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG Calculator Forms
Build a GHG Emissions Calculator. When the user clicks on add emission data button on emission overview module, it should show forms for different scopes and categories inputs. The calculator should cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources as defined in the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors Flat File.
Build input forms with dropdown menus and input fields based on the hierarchy. I am providing the first 2 forms, will provide rest of the forms later.
