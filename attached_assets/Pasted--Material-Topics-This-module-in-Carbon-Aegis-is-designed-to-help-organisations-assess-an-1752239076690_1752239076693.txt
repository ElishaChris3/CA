# Material Topics

**This module** in **Carbon Aegis** is designed to help organisations assess and prioritize the ESG factors that are most relevant to their business operations. This module is built to align with the **EU CSRD/ESRS** regulations and the **EFRAG VSME** standards, ensuring that all organizations can determine both **impact materiality** and **financial materiality** for their operations.

## 1. Topic Identification:

Lists potential ESG topics. User can select or add issues (e.g. emissions, labor rights). Mapping: ESRS 1 requires determining material topics. Inputs: Checkbox or tag list of common topics. Entry Mode: Manual selection; Excel import of topic list. Templates: Pre-populated list from ESRS/Gri taxonomy. Localization: Topic names in EN/DE.

**Data for Figma:**

**Purpose**: To allow users to select ESG topics relevant to their business and industry.

### **Input Form:**

- *Input Type*: Checkbox/Tag list (Multi-select)
- *Display Grouped by ESRS Themes*:
    - **Environment (E1–E5)**
        - GHG Emissions
        - Energy Consumption
        - Water & Marine Resources
        - Biodiversity & Ecosystems
        - Circular Economy & Waste
    - **Social (S1–S4)**
        - Working Conditions
        - Equal Opportunity (Diversity, Inclusion)
        - Health & Safety
        - Human Rights
        - Affected Communities

    ---
    
    - **Add Custom Topic**
        - *Input Type*: Free-text
        - *Tooltip*: *"If a topic isn’t listed, enter it here to add a custom issue (e.g. AI ethics, supply chain disruption)."*
    
    ---
    

## 2. Impact/Magnitude Scoring:

Scores each topic for impact on business and stakeholders. Inputs: Numeric or Likert-scale sliders. Entry Mode: Manual scores. Templates: Materiality scoring template. Localization: Scale labels localized (e.g. “High/Medium/Low”).

**Data for Figma:**
Purpose: Allows users to rate each selected topic’s **impact on the company** (financial materiality) and **impact on people/planet** (impact materiality), along with stakeholder relevance.

### Input Form (Per Topic – Repeatable Section)

| Field | Type | Tooltip | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Financial Impact Score** | Slider (0–5) or Likert Dropdown (None, Low, Medium, High, Critical) | *"How significantly does this topic affect your business's ability to generate value?"* | High |
| **Impact on Stakeholders/Society** | Slider (0–5) or Likert Dropdown | *"How significantly does your organization’s activities related to this topic impact people or the environment?"* | Medium |
| **Stakeholder Concern Level** | Dropdown: Low, Medium, High | *"What is the level of concern shown by stakeholders for this issue?"* | High |
| **Justification (Narrative)** | Multi-line text | *"Describe why this topic is scored this way. Reference internal data or stakeholder input."* | “Significant CO₂ emissions from operations; EU customers pushing for decarbonization.” |

### Scoring Logic (for Backened)

- Each score normalized to 0–5
- Weighting factors:
    - Financial Score (FS) (40%)
    - Impact Score (IS) (40%)
    - Stakeholder Concern (SC) (20%)
- **Materiality Index (0–5)** = Weighted average
    
    Materiality Index = (FS×0.4)+(IS×0.4)+(SC×0.2)
    
- **Threshold**: Topics scoring **>3.0** are flagged as "Material"

| **Materiality Index** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0 – 1.9 | Not material |
| 2.0 – 2.9 | Low materiality (monitor only) |
| 3.0 – 3.9 | Material (report & manage) |
| 4.0 – 5.0 | Highly material (priority topic) |

## 3. Materiality Matrix:

Visual prioritization. Inputs: Coordinates generated from scores. Entry Mode: Automatic calculation from scores. Localization: Axis labels in EN/DE.

**Data for Figma:**

**Purpose:** Automatically plot ESG topics based on scoring into a 2D matrix with editable labels and tooltips.

### Matrix Design

- **X-axis**: Financial Materiality
- **Y-axis**: Impact Materiality
- **Bubble size**: Stakeholder concern level
- **Tooltip on Hover**:
    - Topic Name
    - All 3 scores
- **Matrix Caption**: “Double Materiality Matrix”

### Settings (Editable)

- Axis Label Language: EN / DE
- Threshold Indicator (dotted line): Set at value = 3
- Filter by: Topic group (E/S/G), or Custom Tags
- Export Options: PNG, SVG, PDF

## 4. Material Topics Report:

Final list of material topics with rationale. Inputs: Long-text explanation, dropdown for regulatory references. Entry Mode: Manual editing of narrative. Templates: Narrative template. Localization: Explanations written in both languages (if needed).

**Data for Figma:**

**Purpose**: Generate a final list of material topics for disclosure in sustainability reporting.

### Input Form - (Per Topic Repeatable)

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Material Topic Name** | Auto-filled | - | Water Usage |
